# oknothing/node

this project is not worth looking at. for the curious, it's an incomplete implementation of a balance based cryptocurrency network. it lacks proper working peer2peer, and i have no reason for making this, it's just a thing i was making for fun to get myself back into after a month away from things.

## usage

don't use this. it's incomplete, doesn't work, and serves no purpose.
